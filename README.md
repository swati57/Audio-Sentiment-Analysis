# Audio-Sentiment-Analysis

# Aim
To perform sentiment analysis on basis of audio clips using machine learning algorithms, 
specifically CNN, LSTM and SVM and compare accuracies of results obtained using all three models.

# Procedure
1. Choosing RAVDESS dataset for the model training. The RAVDESS is a validated multimodal database of gender balanced emotional speech and song.
Speech includes calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise,  neutral and disgust expressions.
3. Build an audio sentiment analysis model using CNN on RAVDESS dataset
4. Add live prediction for voice data
5. Build an web app for recording audio
6. Integrate the model with the website for live sentiment prediction


# Result  
Successfully built the audio sentiment analysis model with 73% accuracy.
